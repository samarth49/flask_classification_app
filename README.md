To set up a Flask application for the image classification project, follow these steps:

 Set Up Your Project Directory
Create a directory for your Flask project:

mkdir flask_classification_app
cd flask_classification_app

Create a Virtual Environment
It's good practice to use a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies:


python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Flask and Other Dependencies
Install Flask and the inference_sdk:


pip install Flask inference_sdk

 Run the Flask Application
Run your Flask application using:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
